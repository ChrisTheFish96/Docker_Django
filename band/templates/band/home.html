Even more important, you also wont be able to request events and venues (which is pretty cool and you should check it out in step 3).<br/>
                If you checked your schedule in step 1 and want to join one of the already available events then cool! You'll get updated as the event time comes closer.<br/>
                If those events and venues doesnt sound too hot, move on to step 3 and help us solve that issue!</p>
